# VARI Model on Limit Order Book (LOB) ‚Äì Applied Statistics Project

This repository was developed as part of a one-week group project at **CentraleSup√©lec**, involving four students.  
The project focused on **applied statistics in finance**, specifically the use of the **VARI model** on a **Limit Order Book (LOB)**.

---

## Project Description

The objective was to analyze financial data from a Limit Order Book and apply the **Vector Autoregressive model with Interventions (VARI)** to understand its behavior and potential predictive power.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Personal Contribution

I was fully responsible for the notebook `VAR.ipynb`, which details my step-by-step implementation and exploration of the **VARI model**.  
It includes data loading, preprocessing, modeling, and result interpretation.
